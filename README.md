# searchArray
My solution to the while loop print that is on the workspace on TeamTreehouse Fullstack Developer with JavaScript
video: JavaScript Loops, Arrays and Objects; Useful Array Method.

I just reorder the while loop to put the break at the end of the loop so that all the searches would print but the brower is waiting for the loop to stop before printing the search results.
